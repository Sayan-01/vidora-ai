# Vidora AI - AI Video Generation Platform

A modern, responsive landing page for an AI video generation tool, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Short Notes:
1. Hero section: Designed & generated via Vercel v0 (exported JSX + Tailwind classes). Later, I refined the color combinations, improved responsiveness, and fixed the mobile view of the header section.
2. How it works section: Created with Vercel v0 and customized for responsiveness.
3. Features section: Created with Vercel v0 and customized for responsiveness.
4. Testimonials: Layout composed in Vercel v0; integrated into Next.js components.
5. Pricing: Hand-coded in Next.js with Tailwind (minor tweaks after export).
6. Footer & responsive fixes done manually in the project.
